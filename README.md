Data Science Project: Web Scraping, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete data science project showcasing the lifecycle of data-driven analysis from web scraping to machine learning. It demonstrates practical skills in data collection, cleaning, visualization, and the application of machine learning algorithms using Python.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the full data science lifecycle to a real-world dataset gathered through web scraping, analyze its properties, visualize key insights, and employ machine learning algorithms to address a specific research question clearly.

Main Components

✅ 1. Web Scraping and Dataset Construction
	•	Performed data scraping using Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium).
	•	Constructed a large, structured dataset by extracting, cleaning, and consolidating data from multiple web pages.
	•	Carefully selected features and justified their relevance to the analysis.

✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
	•	Conducted comprehensive exploratory analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
	•	Visualized data distributions, relationships, and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	•	Provided clear and informative visuals to communicate data-driven insights effectively.

✅ 3. Data Optimization and Preprocessing
	•	Optimized the dataset by selecting and retaining only relevant and informative features.
	•	Handled data inconsistencies, NaN values, and incorrect formatting, ensuring robust data integrity.

✅ 4. Machine Learning Implementation
	•	Applied machine learning techniques (regression or clustering) to uncover patterns or relationships within the dataset.
	•	Evaluated the performance of models clearly and justified the choice of algorithms based on data characteristics.

✅ 5. Formal Project Report
	•	Authored a detailed 1500-word report clearly outlining:
	•	The research question and objectives
	•	Methods used in data scraping and preprocessing
	•	Analytical methods and machine learning techniques, with justification
	•	Results obtained, including visualization of findings
	•	Robustness testing and methods to handle common data challenges

✅ 6. Testing and Robustness
	•	Performed thorough testing, demonstrating the resilience of the code to:
	•	Incorrect data types
	•	Missing values (NaNs)
	•	Malformatted data
	•	Documented testing processes clearly, proposing methods for error handling and improving code reliability.
